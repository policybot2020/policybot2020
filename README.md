# Tim Harford's 10 Statistical Commandments of Data & Statistics:
1) Stop and notice our emotional reaction to a claim, rather than accepting or rejecting it, because of how it makes us feel
2) Look for ways to combine the "birds-eye" perspective with the "worms-eye" view of personal experience
3) Look at the labels on the data, ask whether we understand what is being described
4) Look for comparisons and context, putting any claims into perspective
5) Look behind the statistics, where they came from, and what other data might have been excluded
6) Ask who/what is missing from the data being shown, whether our conclusions might differ if they were included
7) Ask tough questions about algorithms and big data sets that drive them, recognizing without intelligent openness, they cannot be trusted
8) Pay more attention to the bedrock of 'official statistics' and the sometimes heroic statisticians who try to protect them.
9) Look under the hood of any beautiful charts/graphs being shared with you
10) Be curious, NOT defensive. ask how we might be mistaken, whether the facts have changed
- LASTLY,  Constantly update your 'model' that makes up your beliefs & projects your reality of the world.
